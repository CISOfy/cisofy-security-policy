# Data > Sensitive Information

The most sensitive data we store is about our customers, our employees, and our business strategies. At any given time, we try to reduce the size of our dataset. Instead of seeing data as an asset, we consider it a liability. That being said, to operate a business, some data has to be retained. As we want to be open about how we deal with data, we provide some of the typical data patterns found in our company and how we deal with it.

## Data stored about potential customers
If one is interested in our offerings, he or she may request a trial account. This account is usually a temporary that lasts for a few weeks. It consists of a user account and usually uploaded data from systems. After the trial period, the account is deleted or upgraded. In the latter, the potential customer has become a customer.

In our customer relationship management system (CRM) we store typically during the trial only the first and last name, the company name, and the email address. This is the bare minimum that we need to set up trial accounts. As we want to keep those people informed during the trial, we add them to a notification list. This way trial tips and notifications about new versions can be received.

## Data stored about customers
Similar to potential customers, we store at least names and company details. This information is needed for invoicing and to provide support. We might enrich the data with extra notes about customers. These notes include their interests or specifics that are relevant for them (e.g. which compliance standards are useful to them).

When a customer does not renew their contract or license, we will ask them to remove any applicable data related to Lynis Enterprise. This is the case for the online (SaaS) option of our services. For self-hosted installations, we have no influence on their data, so no action is required there.

## Data stored for our employees
The number of data assets for empoyees depends on the employee itself. Typical assets include contracts, benefits packages, and personal data that the employees generates (like email, documents).
