# GDPR

The European GDPR is of limited impact for our business. This is mostly because
we do business-to-business. The information stored about individuals, EU
citizens in particular, is typically limited to the name (first, last), business
email address, and personal notes. In most cases we do not store the address
details or personal information of a phone number. If we do, then this is often
related to the company a person is working for.

See Information/Information Systems.md for details on how we store data.
