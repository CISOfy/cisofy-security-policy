# Secure Software Development

Security is embedded in our products.

Usage of common technologies:
* HTTPS
* GPG signed


Repository:
- Limited access
- Preference for HTTPS, HTTP as fallback option
- All repositories are signed
- Highest possible checksums, unless compatibility is required for still supported operating system versions

sha256 on repositories that only support newer operating systems
