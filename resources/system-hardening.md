# System Hardening

System hardening is the process of improving system security. It is done by removing weaknesses, and adding measures that protect against different types of attacks.

## Hardening Guides

A hardening guide can be a great resource to learn what is possible for a particular operating system. With our focus on Linux, macOS, and other Unix-derivatives, here are some of the best guides.

### Ubuntu

Ubuntu is a Linux distribution that was based on Debian (and still is in some areas). It was commonly used on desktops and with its long-term support (LTS) versions it became a popular choice on the server. For this reason we created a guide that provides insights in system hardening on Ubuntu server. After all, some small changes can make it much more secure.
