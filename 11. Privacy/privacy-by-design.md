# Privacy by design

Globalization brought us many good things, including the possibility to do business with other regions. The downside is that rules and regulations are harder to enforce. CISOfy is located in The Netherlands and therefore has to comply with the EU regulations. One thing we appreciate is the principle of 'privacy by design'. A citizen of the EU has the right to know what information is stored about him or her. Additionally, one has the right to ask this, have information changed or even deleted.

From a commercial point of view, companies like to store more and more information about visitors, users, and customers. As a security firm we want to limit the information we store about anyone that does business with us. We no longer use services like Google Analytics to track what happens on our website. We also moved away our CRM solution from the cloud to a self-hosted installation. Besides adhering to the 'privacy by design' principle, CISOfy has to the goal to show that you can do business without spying on users.
