# GDPR

The European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is of limited impact for our business. This is mostly because we do business-to-business. The information stored about individuals, EU citizens in particular, is typically limited to their full name (first, last), with sometimes their personal email address. Typically we do not store address details of individuals, as that is not our typical customer.

The GDPR states that IP addresses should be considered personal data. This because it can be seen as an 'online identifiers'. We do store IP addresses in our logs, mainly for security reasons. This allows us to counter malicious or excessive traffic. We do not use IP addresses for identification of a person. Log files are rotated daily, with at most 60 rotated copies.

## Notes

See Information/Information Systems.md for details on how we store data.
